Creating a shoe laundry e-commerce website involves meticulous planning and execution to ensure it is easy to navigate, visually appealing, and user-friendly. This project, which I undertook solo as the Front-End Developer, aimed to provide customers with a seamless and enjoyable experience when ordering shoe laundry services. Utilizing technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I managed to design and implement a complete and functional website.

The website features a comprehensive booking page where customers can effortlessly schedule their shoe laundry services. This page is designed to be intuitive, allowing users to select the type of service they need, choose their preferred time slot, and provide necessary details with minimal hassle. 

In addition to the booking functionality, I developed a search nearby store page. This feature enables customers to locate the nearest shoe laundry store based on their location. By integrating location services and an interactive map, users can easily find and select the most convenient store for their needs.

To complete the customer experience, I incorporated a secure payment gateway. This ensures that transactions are handled smoothly and safely, giving customers peace of mind when paying for their services online. The payment process is straightforward and supports various payment methods, catering to a wide range of customer preferences.

Throughout the project, my focus was on creating a responsive and visually appealing interface that enhances user engagement. By leveraging my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I successfully developed a robust e-commerce platform that meets the needs of both the business and its customers. This project highlights my ability to manage and execute a complex web development project independently, ensuring a high-quality outcome.
